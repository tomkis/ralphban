## 2026-01-12 - chore-001
- Created unified entry point in server package
- Files changed:
  - packages/server/src/index.ts (replaced with yargs-based arg parser)
  - packages/server/src/cli.ts (new, HTTP server mode)
  - packages/server/src/mcp-cli.ts (new, MCP server mode)
  - packages/server/package.json (added yargs dependency)
- **Learnings:**
  - Dynamic imports used for lazy loading mode-specific code
  - Signal handlers registered in mode modules, not entry point
  - yargs hideBin helper strips node/script args from argv

## 2026-01-12 - chore-002
- Updated server package.json for npx publishing
- Files changed:
  - packages/server/package.json (added bin, prebuild, updated build)
- **Learnings:**
  - private:false and yargs were already added in chore-001
  - prebuild copies web/dist to web-dist before tsc runs
  - chmod +x ensures bin works without explicit node call
  - files array needs web-dist to include static assets in npm package
---

## 2026-01-12 - chore-003
- Updated root package.json bin entry and scripts
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added bin, removed cli/mcp from scripts)
  - scripts/tests.sh (build server instead of mcp-cli, use SKIP_GIT_VALIDATION/SKIP_API_KEY_CHECK)
  - packages/server/src/ralph/service.ts (use --mcp flag in MCP config)
  - packages/server/src/cli.ts (add SKIP_GIT_VALIDATION/SKIP_API_KEY_CHECK env vars)
  - packages/server/src/server.ts (fix Express 5 wildcard route syntax)
- **Learnings:**
  - Express 5 requires `{*path}` instead of `*` for wildcard routes
  - Test script needs env vars to bypass validations that block dev workflow
  - MCP invocation needs --mcp flag now that server handles both modes
  - build:all order matters: api -> web -> server (server prebuild copies web dist)

## 2026-01-12 - chore-004
- Removed redundant packages/cli directory
- Files changed:
  - packages/cli (deleted entirely)
- **Learnings:**
  - CLI functionality already moved to server package in chore-001
  - No code changes needed, simple directory removal
  - pnpm workspace auto-updates when package dir removed
---

## 2026-01-12 - chore-005
- Removed redundant packages/mcp-cli directory
- Files changed:
  - packages/mcp-cli (deleted entirely)
- **Learnings:**
  - MCP CLI functionality already moved to server package in chore-001
  - Same pattern as chore-004, simple directory removal
  - Tests still pass after removal
