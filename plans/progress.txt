## 2026-01-09 - CHORE-001
- Created `packages/server/src/ralph/` module
- Added `ralph.sh` script that takes working directory and prompt as args
- Script cd's to working dir before invoking claude
- Files changed: `packages/server/src/ralph/ralph.sh`
- **Learnings:**
  - Existing `plans/ralph.sh` reads prompt from file, new script takes it as argument
  - Script outputs claude result and checks for `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` marker
