## 2026-01-12 - chore-001
- Created unified entry point in server package
- Files changed:
  - packages/server/src/index.ts (replaced with yargs-based arg parser)
  - packages/server/src/cli.ts (new, HTTP server mode)
  - packages/server/src/mcp-cli.ts (new, MCP server mode)
  - packages/server/package.json (added yargs dependency)
- **Learnings:**
  - Dynamic imports used for lazy loading mode-specific code
  - Signal handlers registered in mode modules, not entry point
  - yargs hideBin helper strips node/script args from argv

## 2026-01-12 - chore-002
- Updated server package.json for npx publishing
- Files changed:
  - packages/server/package.json (added bin, prebuild, updated build)
- **Learnings:**
  - private:false and yargs were already added in chore-001
  - prebuild copies web/dist to web-dist before tsc runs
  - chmod +x ensures bin works without explicit node call
  - files array needs web-dist to include static assets in npm package
