## 2026-01-15 - chore-002
- Threading cwd through server init was already implemented in chore-001
- Verified: cli.ts -> server.ts -> adapter.ts -> context.ts -> ralph/trpc-service.ts
- Files changed: plans/prd.json (marked passes: true)
- **Learnings:**
  - chore-001 commit included full threading implementation
  - ServerConfig already had cwd, createTrpcHandler/createContext already passing it

## 2026-01-15 - chore-003
- Removed workingDirectory parameter from Ralph API
- IRalphService.start() now takes no params, uses cwd from closure
- Removed StartRalphInputSchema, ralph.start mutation takes no input
- Updated UI modal to not pass workingDirectory (simplified)
- Files changed: packages/api/src/context.ts, packages/api/src/routers/ralph.ts, packages/server/src/ralph/trpc-service.ts, packages/web/src/App.tsx
- **Learnings:**
  - tRPC mutation without input just uses `.mutation(async ({ ctx }) => {...})`
  - WorkingDirectoryModal kept for now (feat-001 will remove it completely)
