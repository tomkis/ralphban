## 2026-01-08 - FEAT-001
- Added @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.0.4 dependency
- Files changed: packages/server/package.json
- **Learnings:**
  - MCP SDK is foundational dependency for all MCP server implementation tasks
  - Dependency installed successfully without conflicts
  - No type errors introduced
---

## 2026-01-08 - CHORE-001
- Created task service layer with getTasksReadyForImplementation and markTaskAsCompleted functions
- Files changed: packages/server/src/services/task-service.ts (new)
- **Learnings:**
  - Service layer wraps existing repository functions to provide higher-level abstractions
  - getTasksReadyForImplementation returns single pending task as array for consistency
  - markTaskAsCompleted delegates to updatePRDStatus with 'Done' state
  - Service layer pattern established for future MCP tool implementations
---

## 2026-01-08 - FEAT-002
- Created MCP server module with createMCPServer function
- Implemented tools/list handler exposing get_tasks_ready_for_implementation and mark_task_done tools
- Implemented tools/call handler for both tools
- Files changed: packages/server/src/mcp/server.ts (new)
- **Learnings:**
  - MCP Server requires 'as any' type assertions for setRequestHandler due to SDK type limitations
  - MCP server initialization requires name, version, and capabilities configuration
  - Tool handlers return content array with text type for responses
  - get_tasks_ready_for_implementation tool delegates to service layer
  - mark_task_done tool accepts taskId parameter and delegates to service layer
  - StdioServerTransport import added but not yet used (will be needed for HTTP transport in FEAT-006)
