## 2026-01-08 - CHORE-003
- Removed agent folder from packages/server/src/agent
- Removed @ai-sdk/anthropic and ai dependencies from package.json
- Kept @modelcontextprotocol/sdk as it's used by MCP server (not agent)
- Files changed: packages/server/package.json, packages/server/src/agent/ (deleted)
- **Learnings:**
  - MCP server is separate from agent - don't remove MCP SDK
  - eventsource-parser is used by MCP SDK, not agent directly
