## 2026-01-14 - feat-002
- Created reusable Modal component with Modal and ModalButton exports
- Modal accepts: isOpen, onClose, title, children, footer (ReactNode)
- ModalButton accepts: onClick, disabled, variant (primary/secondary), children
- Refactored WorkingDirectoryModal to use new Modal component
- Files changed:
  - packages/web/src/components/Modal.tsx (new)
  - packages/web/src/App.tsx (modified)
- **Learnings:**
  - Modal uses composition pattern via children+footer props instead of rigid props
  - ModalButton variant approach allows consistent styling across modals
  - Components directory created for future UI components
