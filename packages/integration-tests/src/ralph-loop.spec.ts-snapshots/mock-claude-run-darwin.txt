# Ralph Agent Instructions

## Your Task

1. Call `get_progress` tool to read progress from completed tasks and understand past context
2. Call `get_tasks_ready_for_implementation` tool to get tasks ready to implement
3. Pick highest priority task
   - Tasks are NOT sorted by priority
   - Think about which one is right to pick based on dependencies
4. Implement that ONE task
5. Call `mark_task_done` tool with the task ID and progress summary
6. Terminate, you are only supposed to work on ONE task

If no tasks are returned, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

## Important Rules

- Only implement ONE task per run
- When marking task done, provide progress summary:
  - What was implemented
  - Important files changed
  - Learnings (gotchas encountered, proposed follow-ups)
